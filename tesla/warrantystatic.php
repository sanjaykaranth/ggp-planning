	<p style="font-size:110%;"><b>PhiTesla Product Warranty Service:</b></p> <br />

	<span>These terms apply to India customers only; warranty terms may vary by
	country.</span><br /><br />

	<span>PhiTesla stands behind its products and its customers'
	satisfaction. We warrant that our products will be free from defects
	or failure due to workmanship, material, or normal use for the stated
	warranty period. If the product is covered under warranty, you may
	return it at your expense; we will repair or replace and return the
	defective product without cost to you.</span><br /><br />

	<span style="font-size:110%;"><b>Warranty Limitations</b></span> <br
	/><br />

	<span>PhiTesla products are covered by a limited liability warranty from
	defects in material and workmanship. This warranty does not apply if,
	in the judgment of PhiTesla, the product fails due to damage from
	shipment, handling, storage, accident, abuse or misuse, or if it has
	been used or maintained in a manner not conforming to product's
	instructions, has been modified in any way, or has a defaced or
	removed serial number. Repair by anyone other than PhiTesla or an
	approved agent voids this warranty. The maximum liability of PhiTesla
	under any circumstance is the product purchase price.</span><br /><br />

	<span style="font-size:110%;"><b>Warranty Procedure</b></span><br /><br />
	<span>If you think the item should be covered under warranty, please contact
	PhiTesla at techsupport@phitesla.com. We will go through a
	troubleshooting process to determine if the item is under warranty. If
	we can verify it is covered by warranty we will give you a Return
	Authorization Number and have you ship it to us for servicing. Please
	note: You will need to provide PhiTesla a valid proof of
	purchase.</span><br /><br />

	<span>We recommend shipping by a method that provides tracking capabilities,
	for your security. PhiTesla will return the item by standard ground
	shipping and can not ship to P.O. Boxes. Extra charges associated with
	non-standard shipping will be the responsibility of the
	customer. International customers may contact PhiTesla for more
	information on how to obtain warranty support in your
	country.</span><br /><br />


	<span><i>Note: PhiTesla advises you to open your product immediately
		after receiving the package and check for physical damage caused due
		to improper shipping if any. In case the product is found
		damaged, please contact <a href="mailto:techsupport@phitesla.com">techsupport@phitesla.com</a> within 24
